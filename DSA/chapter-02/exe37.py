"""Write a simulator, as in the previous project, but add a Boolean gender
ﬁeld and a ﬂoating-point strength ﬁeld to each animal, using an Animal
class as a base class. If two animals of the same type try to collide, then
they only create a new instance of that type of animal if they are of differ-
ent genders. Otherwise, if two animals of the same type and gender try to
collide, then only the one of larger strength survives."""
