## About

This chapter is about object-oriented programming in python. Python is purely an object-oriented languge. Everything in python is an object. In a very deep sense there are no primitives in python as the CPU don't directly work with objects in python. The CPU understands different types with the help of the interpreter. <br>

For instance, when we are working a variable, say, 2. There have to be some processes by the python interpreter before the CPU will treat that variable as an integer. This different in some more lower level languages like C, C++, rust, go, etc.
