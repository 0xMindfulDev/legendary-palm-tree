"""At the close of Section 2.4.1, we suggest a model in which the CreditCard
class supports a nonpublic method, set balance(b), that could be used
by subclasses to affect a change to the balance, without directly accessing
the balance data member. Implement such a model, revising both the
CreditCard and PredatoryCreditCard classes accordingly."""
